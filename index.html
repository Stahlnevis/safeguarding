      <h2>About Elimu</h2>
      <p>

        their educational and work-related goals. Over the years, the objectives of Elimu became clearer and the focus has
        been honed from ‘enhancing access to education’ to ‘providing solutions for vulnerable children, youth, and adults
        to achieve their life goals at every stage of their learning’.

      <p>
        This policy document has been developed to ensure that staff, interns/volunteers, and partners of Elimu have

        The legal framework states that all children under the age of 18 have a right to protection from abuse or

        against the very beliefs, values, and aims of our organization. We have a responsibility to ensure that all
        employees, volunteers, consultants, and partners are given clear guidance about the standards of behavior and
        practice required of them at all times when they are in contact with children.
